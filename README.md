# A This Week in Matrix Skill for opsdroid

This is a skill for storing TWIM updates in #twim:matrix.org

## configuration


```yaml
skills:
  - name: twim
    repo: https://github.com/Cadair/skill-twim
```

This works especially well in conjuction with the [matrix
connector](https://github.com/opsdroid/connector-matrix) and the [matrix
database](https://github.com/SolarDrew/database-matrix).
